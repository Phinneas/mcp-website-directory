# Understanding Our MCP Quality Standards

Not all MCP servers are created equal. At MCP Directory, we believe in **quality over quantity**. Here's how we ensure every server in our directory meets the highest standards.

## Our Quality Criteria

### 1. GitHub Stars (10+ Minimum)
We require a minimum of **10 GitHub stars**, but most of our featured servers have significantly more:

- **Major Platforms**: 100-1000+ stars (Redis, Kubernetes, Elasticsearch)
- **Popular Tools**: 50-200 stars (Sentry, Raygun, Firebase)
- **Emerging Projects**: 10-50 stars (with strong potential)

### 2. Active Maintenance
Projects must show signs of active development:
- **Recent commits** within the last 6 months
- **Responsive maintainers** to issues and PRs
- **Regular updates** and version releases
- **Clear roadmap** for future development

### 3. Proper Documentation
Every server must have comprehensive documentation:
- **Clear README** with setup instructions
- **Installation guides** (npm, pip, etc.)
- **Configuration examples**
- **Usage demonstrations**
- **API documentation** where applicable

### 4. Working Examples
We verify that servers include:
- **Demo implementations**
- **Code samples**
- **Integration tutorials**
- **Real-world use cases**

### 5. Community Engagement
Signs of a healthy community:
- **Active GitHub discussions**
- **Issue resolution**
- **Community contributions**
- **User testimonials**

## Priority System

### Tier 1: Official Company Servers
**Highest Priority** - Servers maintained by established companies:
- **AWS, Google, Microsoft** cloud services
- **GitHub, GitLab** development platforms  
- **Slack, Discord** communication tools
- **MongoDB, Redis** database providers

### Tier 2: High-Quality Community Projects
**Medium Priority** - Well-maintained community projects:
- 50+ GitHub stars
- Multiple contributors
- Regular updates
- Strong documentation

### Tier 3: Emerging Quality Projects
**Lower Priority** - Promising new projects:
- 10-50 GitHub stars
- Single maintainer (but responsive)
- Recent creation but active development
- Unique functionality or niche use case

## What We Don't Include

We specifically **exclude** servers that:
- Have fewer than 10 GitHub stars
- Show no activity for 6+ months
- Lack proper documentation
- Have unresolved critical issues
- Are abandoned or deprecated
- Have security concerns

## Verification Process

Our curation process includes:

1. **Automated Checks**: Star count, commit history, package status
2. **Manual Review**: Documentation quality, code structure
3. **Testing**: Installation and basic functionality
4. **Community Research**: User feedback, known issues
5. **Ongoing Monitoring**: Regular re-evaluation of included servers

## The Result

By maintaining these standards, we've built a directory of **165+ premium MCP servers** with:
- **250,000+ combined GitHub stars**
- **100% working GitHub links**
- **Comprehensive metadata** for each server
- **16 organized categories**
- **Multiple programming languages** represented

## Looking Ahead

Our goal is to reach **500 high-quality servers** while never compromising on these standards. Quality curation takes time, but it ensures developers can trust every server in our directory.
