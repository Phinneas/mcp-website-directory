# MCP Client: What It Is, How to Choose One, and Getting Started

Your AI assistant is brilliant at conversation and reasoning. But without access to your files, databases, APIs, and development tools, it's working with one hand tied behind its back.

That's where MCP clients come in. An MCP client is the bridge that connects AI applications to external data sources and tools through the Model Context Protocol standard. Think of it as the USB port for your AI—a universal interface that lets your assistant plug into practically anything.

If you've been wondering how Claude Desktop reads your local files, how Cursor understands your codebase, or how developers are building AI agents that actually do things in the real world, MCP clients are the answer. For a deeper dive into the protocol itself, see our [Complete Technical Guide to Model Context Protocol](/blog/mcp-protocol-guide/).

## Quick Answer: Which MCP Client Should You Use?

Before diving deep, here's the fast track. Pick your situation:

| If you are... | Use this client | Why it wins |
|---------------|----------------|-------------|
| Claude power user | Claude Desktop | Native MCP support, zero friction setup |
| Developer in VS Code | Cline or Roo Code | Full MCP support, open-source, excellent tool integration |
| Cursor user | Cursor | Built-in MCP with AI coding features |
| Non-technical user | Jenova | One-click server installation, mobile-friendly |
| Building custom apps | LangChain MCP Adapters | Framework flexibility, works with any LLM |
| CLI/automation fan | Claude Code or Goose | Terminal-native, no JSON editing required |
| Self-hosting enthusiast | LibreChat | Full control, supports local LLMs |
| JetBrains user | JetBrains AI MCP | Native IDE integration for IntelliJ, PyCharm, WebStorm |

Still not sure? Read on—we'll break down exactly what MCP clients do and how to pick the right one.

## What Is an MCP Client?

An MCP client is a software component that implements the client side of the Model Context Protocol. In plain terms: it's the piece of software that requests data and actions from MCP servers on behalf of an AI application.

Here's the key distinction that trips up most people:

- **MCP Host**: The AI application you interact with (Claude Desktop, Cursor, your custom chatbot)
- **MCP Client**: The protocol handler inside that host that manages server connections
- **MCP Server**: External services providing tools, resources, and data

When you ask Claude Desktop to "read my project files," here's what happens:

1. Claude Desktop (the host) receives your request
2. The MCP client inside Claude Desktop sends a JSON-RPC message to the filesystem MCP server
3. The server reads your files and returns the content
4. The client passes this back to Claude for processing

Most users never see the client directly—it works behind the scenes. But understanding it helps you choose the right AI application and troubleshoot connection issues.

## MCP Architecture: Where Clients Fit

The Model Context Protocol follows a client-server architecture with three layers:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    MCP HOST                         │
│  (Claude Desktop, Cursor, Your Custom App)         │
│                                                     │
│   ┌─────────────┐  ┌─────────────┐  ┌───────────┐  │
│   │ MCP Client  │  │ MCP Client  │  │MCP Client │  │
│   │     #1      │  │     #2      │  │    #3     │  │
│   └──────┬──────┘  └──────┬──────┘  └─────┬─────┘  │
└──────────┼────────────────┼───────────────┼────────┘
           │                │               │
           ▼                ▼               ▼
    ┌──────────────┐ ┌──────────────┐ ┌──────────────┐
    │  Filesystem  │ │    GitHub    │ │   Database   │
    │  MCP Server  │ │  MCP Server  │ │  MCP Server  │
    └──────────────┘ └──────────────┘ └──────────────┘
```

A single MCP host can run multiple clients, each connecting to a different server. This is how Claude Desktop can simultaneously access your files, query your database, and interact with GitHub—each through a separate MCP client-server connection.

## What Makes MCP Clients Different from Direct API Calls?

You might wonder: why not just have the AI call APIs directly?

MCP clients solve several problems:

- **Standardization**: Instead of custom integrations for every service, MCP provides one protocol that works everywhere
- **Security**: Clients handle authentication, permission scoping, and data exposure in a controlled way
- **Discovery**: Clients can query servers to learn what tools are available at runtime
- **Lifecycle management**: Clients handle connection setup, error recovery, and graceful shutdown

Without MCP, every AI application would need custom code for every external service. With MCP, you configure a server once and any compatible client can use it.

## How MCP Clients Work

MCP clients communicate using JSON-RPC 2.0 over one of several transport mechanisms:

### Transport Methods

- **STDIO (Standard Input/Output)**: The most common method for local servers. The client spawns the server as a subprocess and communicates through stdin/stdout pipes. Fast, simple, and works offline.
- **SSE (Server-Sent Events)**: Used for remote servers. The client connects via HTTP and receives a stream of events. Good for cloud-hosted MCP servers.
- **Streamable HTTP**: A newer transport that combines the flexibility of HTTP with streaming capabilities. Gaining adoption for production deployments.

### Connection Lifecycle

Every MCP client follows this sequence:

1. **Initialize**: Client sends capabilities and protocol version
2. **Negotiate**: Server responds with its capabilities
3. **Discover**: Client requests available tools, resources, and prompts
4. **Execute**: Client sends requests; server responds with results
5. **Terminate**: Clean shutdown when the host application closes

Here's what an initialization handshake looks like:

```json
// Client → Server
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "method": "initialize",
  "params": {
    "protocolVersion": "2024-11-05",
    "capabilities": {
      "roots": { "listChanged": true }
    },
    "clientInfo": {
      "name": "claude-desktop",
      "version": "1.0.0"
    }
  }
}

// Server → Client
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "result": {
    "protocolVersion": "2024-11-05",
    "capabilities": {
      "tools": {}
    },
    "serverInfo": {
      "name": "filesystem-server",
      "version": "0.1.0"
    }
  }
}
```

After initialization, the client can call tools:

```json
// Client → Server
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 2,
  "method": "tools/call",
  "params": {
    "name": "read_file",
    "arguments": {
      "path": "/Users/dev/project/README.md"
    }
  }
}
```

Understanding this protocol helps when debugging—if your MCP server isn't responding, you can check logs for failed handshakes or malformed requests.

### Checklist: Questions to Ask

Before committing to a client, verify:

- ✅ Does it support STDIO transport? (required for most MCP servers)
- ✅ Can it connect to multiple servers simultaneously?
- ✅ Does it work with your preferred LLM?
- ✅ Is it available on your operating system?
- ✅ Does it support SSE/HTTP transport? (needed for remote servers)
- ✅ What's the debugging experience like?
- ✅ Is it actively maintained?

## Getting Started: Your First MCP Client Setup

Let's get you running with Claude Desktop—the reference implementation that's straightforward to set up and works reliably.

### Step 1: Install Claude Desktop

Download Claude Desktop from claude.ai/download. Available for macOS and Windows.

### Step 2: Locate Your Configuration File

The MCP configuration lives in a JSON file:

- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

If the file doesn't exist, create it.

### Step 3: Add Your First MCP Server

Let's add the official filesystem server so Claude can read files on your computer.

First, ensure you have Node.js installed (version 18+).

Then add this configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "filesystem": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem",
        "/Users/yourname/Documents"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Replace `/Users/yourname/Documents` with the directory you want Claude to access.

### Step 4: Restart Claude Desktop

Quit Claude Desktop completely (check your system tray/menu bar) and relaunch it.

### Step 5: Verify the Connection

In Claude Desktop, look for the MCP icon (hammer/tools) in the input area. Click it to see connected servers.

Test by asking: "What files are in my Documents folder?"

If Claude lists your files, congratulations—you've got MCP working.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

- **Server not appearing**: Check that Node.js is installed and in your PATH. Try running the npx command manually in terminal.
- **Permission errors**: Ensure the directory path exists and Claude has read access.
- **JSON syntax errors**: Validate your config file at jsonlint.com. Missing commas and brackets are common culprits.
- **Server crashes on startup**: Check Claude Desktop's logs at:
  - **macOS**: `~/Library/Logs/Claude/`
  - **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\logs\`

## MCP Client Security Considerations

MCP gives AI significant power over your systems. Here's how clients handle security:

### Authentication and Authorization

OAuth 2.1 is the standard for remote MCP servers. Clients handle the authentication flow and store tokens securely. For local servers (STDIO transport), security relies on filesystem permissions—the server can only access what the user running it can access.

### Permission Scoping

Good MCP clients let you limit what servers can do:

- **Read-only access**: Servers can fetch data but not modify anything
- **Directory restrictions**: Limit file access to specific paths
- **Tool allowlists**: Enable only specific tools from a server

Claude Desktop's filesystem server, for example, only accesses directories you explicitly configure.

### Data Exposure Risks

Be aware that MCP servers can access sensitive data. Before connecting a server:

- Review what data it can access
- Check who maintains the server (official Anthropic servers vs. community)
- Understand what data might be sent to the LLM

### Enterprise Deployment

For organizational use, consider:

- Running MCP servers on isolated infrastructure
- Implementing network-level access controls
- Using audit logging to track tool usage
- Establishing approval processes for new server connections

## Building a Custom MCP Client

Need to embed MCP in your own application? Official SDKs are available:

### Python

```bash
pip install mcp
```

```python
from mcp import ClientSession, StdioServerParameters
from mcp.client.stdio import stdio_client

async with stdio_client(StdioServerParameters(
    command="npx",
    args=["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/tmp"]
)) as (read, write):
    async with ClientSession(read, write) as session:
        await session.initialize()
        tools = await session.list_tools()
```

### TypeScript

```bash
npm install @modelcontextprotocol/sdk
```

```typescript
import { Client } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/client/index.js";
import { StdioClientTransport } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/client/stdio.js";

const transport = new StdioClientTransport({
  command: "npx",
  args: ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/tmp"]
});
const client = new Client({ name: "my-client", version: "1.0.0" });
await client.connect(transport);
```

Other languages: Java, C#, Kotlin, and Swift SDKs are available. Check the official MCP SDK documentation for details.

### When to build custom:

- You need deep integration with an existing application
- Commercial clients don't support your LLM provider
- You require custom security, logging, or compliance features
- You're building a product that uses MCP internally

### When to use existing clients:

- You're a user, not a developer
- Existing clients meet your needs
- You want community support and regular updates

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Is an MCP client the same as an AI agent?**

No. An MCP client is a component inside an AI agent that handles communication with MCP servers. The agent is the larger system that decides when to use tools, how to interpret results, and what actions to take. The client just handles the protocol mechanics.

**What's the difference between an MCP client and an LLM?**

The LLM is the AI brain that understands language and generates responses. The MCP client is the communication layer that lets that brain reach external tools and data. Without an MCP client, the LLM can only work with information in its training data and your conversation.

**Can I use MCP with ChatGPT or other non-Claude models?**

Yes, but not through ChatGPT's web interface. MCP is model-agnostic—you can use it with any LLM through compatible clients. LangChain MCP Adapters, LibreChat, and other clients support GPT-4, Llama, Mistral, and other models.

**Do I need an MCP client to use MCP servers?**

Yes. MCP servers don't run standalone—they wait for client connections. You need some client (whether Claude Desktop, a custom app, or a CLI tool) to connect to and use them.

**How many MCP servers can I connect at once?**

Most clients support multiple simultaneous server connections. Claude Desktop, Cursor, and Cline all handle multiple servers well. The practical limit depends on your system resources and the servers' resource usage.

**Are MCP clients free?**

Most MCP clients are free. Claude Desktop, Cline, Goose, and many others cost nothing to use. Some, like Cursor, have paid tiers for additional features. The LLM usage (API calls to Claude, GPT-4, etc.) may incur costs depending on your provider.
