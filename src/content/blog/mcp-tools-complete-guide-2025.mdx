# MCP Tools: The Complete Guide to Finding & Using Tools in 2025

AI agents are becoming increasingly powerful, but they're limited by what they can actually *do*. Without tools, an AI model is just a text generator—it can't query your database, call your APIs, execute workflows, or interact with real systems. **MCP tools bridge that gap.**

This guide covers everything you need to understand, find, and implement MCP tools in your AI applications. Whether you're building with Claude, VS Code, Cursor, Google ADK, or another platform, you'll find practical guidance and examples throughout.

## What Is MCP in the AI Context?

**MCP stands for Model Context Protocol.** It's an open standard that allows AI agents to discover and use tools in a standardized way, regardless of which AI model or platform you're using.

Think of MCP as a universal translator between AI models and the tools they need to access. Instead of each AI platform creating its own tool integration system, MCP provides a common language that any AI agent can understand.

### MCP ≠ Other Definitions

You might also encounter "MCP" in other contexts:
- **Manufacturing Control Plan** (supply chain/quality management)
- **Microsoft Certified Professional** (legacy IT certification)
- **Master Control Program** (science fiction/Tron)
- **Managed Service Provider** (IT services—more commonly MSP)

**This article focuses exclusively on Model Context Protocol in AI contexts.** If you're searching for something else, you'll want to search for the specific domain term instead.

### Why MCP Tools Matter Right Now

The MCP ecosystem is growing explosively. In 2024-2025, search interest in MCP has increased 300-700% year-over-year. Major AI platforms are racing to integrate MCP support:
- **Claude** (Anthropic) has native MCP support
- **VS Code + GitHub Copilot** integrated MCP tools
- **Cursor IDE** recently added MCP compatibility
- **Google ADK** (Agent Development Kit) is building MCP integration
- **Amazon Bedrock** is exploring MCP implementations

This isn't a niche protocol anymore—it's becoming the standard for AI-tool interaction.

## Key Concepts: Understanding the MCP Hierarchy

Before diving into tools specifically, you need to understand how MCP concepts relate to each other. Confusion here is the #1 reason people struggle with MCP implementations.

### The Three Core MCP Concepts

**1. The MCP Protocol (The Framework)**

MCP itself is the communication protocol—the standardized way clients and servers exchange information. It defines how messages are formatted, how discovery works, and how the conversation happens. Think of it like HTTP: the underlying protocol that everything else uses.

You rarely interact with the protocol directly. It just works in the background.

**2. Tools (The Focus of This Article)**

Tools are specific functions that an MCP server exposes. Tools allow AI agents to *take actions*—execute code, call APIs, query databases, modify files, trigger workflows, send notifications.

Examples of MCP tools:
- `query_database` (execute SQL)
- `create_github_issue` (create issues in GitHub)
- `send_slack_message` (post to Slack)
- `read_file` (access documents)
- `execute_python` (run Python code)

Tools are what make AI agents useful beyond conversation.

**3. Resources (The Difference People Forget)**

Resources are what MCP servers provide for AI agents to *read*—documentation, knowledge bases, file contents, API schemas. Unlike tools, resources don't let the AI take action; they provide information the AI can use to decide what tools to call.

Example resources:
- `database_schema.json` (tells AI what tables/columns exist)
- `api_documentation.txt` (guides the AI on API usage)
- `company_policies.md` (provides context for decisions)

**4. Prompts (System Instructions)**

Prompts are instructions to the AI itself about how to think and behave. They're separate from both tools and resources.

- **Tools** = what the AI can *do*
- **Resources** = what the AI can *read*
- **Prompts** = how the AI should *think*

### Visual Hierarchy

```
MCP Protocol (the standard)
├── Tools (actions the AI can take)
│   ├── Data access (query databases, read APIs)
│   ├── Execution (run code, trigger workflows)
│   └── Integration (connect services)
├── Resources (information for the AI)
│   ├── Schemas (database structures)
│   ├── Documentation (API guides)
│   └── Context (knowledge, policies)
└── Prompts (AI behavior instructions)
    ├── System prompts
    └── Role definitions
```

**Key distinction**: When you search "MCP tools," you're asking about the Tools layer—what AI agents can *do*. This is different from asking about the MCP protocol itself or other MCP components.

## How MCP Tools Actually Work

Understanding the mechanism helps explain why MCP exists and why it's valuable.

### The Client-Server Architecture

Every MCP setup has two components:

1. **MCP Client**: The application using the tools (Claude, VS Code, Cursor, ADK, your custom agent)
2. **MCP Server**: The application providing the tools (database connector, API wrapper, file manager, Notion integrator, etc.)

The client doesn't know what tools the server provides. It just knows how to ask. The server doesn't know who's using it. It just knows how to respond.

### The Tool Discovery Flow

Here's what happens when you start an MCP-enabled application:

```
1. Client connects to MCP server
2. Client says: "What tools do you have?"
3. Server responds: "I have these tools: [list with descriptions]"
4. Client makes tools available to AI model
5. AI can now call any of those tools
```

This is why MCP is powerful: **tools are discovered automatically**. The client doesn't need pre-built integrations or hard-coded knowledge. It just asks the server what's available.

### The Tool Invocation Flow

When an AI model needs to use a tool:

```
1. AI says: "I want to use the query_database tool"
2. Client sends request: "Please call query_database with these parameters"
3. Server executes: Runs the actual database query
4. Server responds: "Here are the results"
5. Client gives results back to AI: "Here's what happened"
6. AI continues reasoning with this new information
```

This happens in real-time, allowing the AI to get actual information instead of just predicting what might be true.

### Concrete Example: AI Querying a Database

Let's say you're using Claude with a database MCP server, and you ask: "How many users signed up yesterday?"

Here's what happens under the hood:

```
YOU: "How many users signed up yesterday?"

CLAUDE: "I need to query the database. Let me use the query_database tool."

MCP CLIENT → MCP SERVER:
{
  "tool": "query_database",
  "params": {
    "query": "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users WHERE created_at >= DATE(NOW() - INTERVAL 1 DAY)"
  }
}

MCP SERVER executes the actual query and responds:
{
  "result": 247
}

CLAUDE: "Based on the actual database query, 247 users signed up yesterday."
```

Without MCP tools, Claude would say something like "I can't access your database, but typically signups vary between 100-500 per day." With MCP tools, Claude gives you the *actual answer*.

### Why Standardization Matters

Before MCP, each platform (Claude, GPT, Anthropic's SDK, LangChain, etc.) had its own way of defining tools. A database integration for Claude wouldn't work with GPT. Tool definitions weren't consistent.

MCP solves this: **one tool definition works everywhere**. You define your database MCP server once, and any MCP-compatible client can use it. This is massive for:

- **Developers**: Write tool integrations once, use everywhere
- **Enterprises**: Standardize on one tool format
- **Tool creators**: Broader audience, more adoption

## Types of MCP Tools

MCP tools generally fall into five categories. Understanding these helps you figure out what tools you need.

### 1. Data Access Tools

Tools that let AI read from data sources without modifying them.

**Examples:**
- Query databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB)
- Read files (documents, spreadsheets, code)
- Call read-only APIs (weather data, public records)
- Search vector databases (RAG/semantic search)
- Access knowledge bases (wikis, docs)

**MyMCPShelf category:** [Database Tools](https://www.mymcpshelf.com) — Browse tools for SQL databases, NoSQL, vector DBs, and data connectors.

### 2. Action/Execution Tools

Tools that let AI *do things*—take actions that change the world.

**Examples:**
- Execute code (Python, JavaScript, shell)
- Create/modify files
- Run workflows/scripts
- Send notifications (email, Slack, SMS)
- Control systems

**MyMCPShelf category:** [Development Tools](https://www.mymcpshelf.com) — Find tools for code execution, DevOps, CI/CD, and automation.

### 3. Integration Tools

Tools that connect your AI to third-party services via their APIs.

**Examples:**
- GitHub integration (create issues, read repos, deploy)
- Notion integration (query databases, create pages)
- Slack integration (send messages, read channels)
- Stripe integration (query transactions, manage subscriptions)
- Google Workspace (Gmail, Sheets, Drive)

## Specifications & Limits: What You Need to Know

When implementing MCP tools, you'll need to understand practical constraints and specifications.

### How Many Types of MCP Are There?

**One.** There's one MCP protocol. But it supports different types of *integrations*:

- MCP for LLMs (Claude, in-context tool discovery)
- MCP for IDEs (VS Code, real-time code assistance)
- MCP for agent frameworks (ADK, multi-step reasoning)
- MCP for agent orchestration (tools composed together)

The protocol is the same; the context differs.

### What's the Maximum Number of Tools in MCP?

There's **no hard limit**, but practical considerations apply:

- **5-15 tools**: Optimal for single-purpose servers (great UX)
- **15-50 tools**: Medium servers (databases with many tables, complex APIs)
- **50+ tools**: Large enterprise servers (comprehensive system integration)

Why the limits matter: Each additional tool increases the tokens needed to describe what's available, which increases latency and API costs. More tools also increase the complexity the AI must navigate (decision paralysis).

**Best practice:** Group related operations into single tools with parameters. Instead of `create_user`, `create_admin`, `create_guest`, create one `create_user` tool with a `role` parameter.

### Tool Input Schema Limits

Each tool has a JSON schema describing its parameters:

```json
{
  "name": "query_database",
  "description": "Query the database with SQL",
  "input_schema": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "query": { "type": "string" },
      "timeout": { "type": "number" }
    }
  }
}
```

**Specifications:**
- Keep descriptions under 200 characters
- Limit to 10-15 parameters per tool
- Use enums for fixed options (reduces AI confusion)
- Provide examples in parameter descriptions

### Execution Timeouts

Different platforms have different timeout limits:

- **Claude (via API)**: 5 minute default
- **VS Code extension**: 30 second timeout typical
- **Cursor**: 10-30 seconds
- **Google ADK**: 60 second default

Plan your tools for quick execution (< 5 seconds ideal). For long-running operations, return a job ID and provide a separate "check status" tool.

### Concurrency & Rate Limits

MCP doesn't enforce limits, but your server should:

- **Rate limit** concurrent requests from the same client
- **Connection pooling** for database tools (10-20 connections typical)
- **Request queuing** for high-volume scenarios
- **Error handling** for timeouts and failures

### Response Size Limits

There's no hard limit, but practical concerns:

- **Small responses** (< 1 KB): Instant, ideal
- **Medium responses** (1-100 KB): Usually fine
- **Large responses** (100+ KB): Can cause latency
- **Very large responses** (1+ MB): Will hit token limits

For large data, use pagination or return a reference instead of the full dataset.

## How to Use MCP Tools: Platform-Specific Guides

This is the question people ask most often: **"How do I actually use MCP tools?"** Here's platform-specific guidance.

### Using MCP Tools in Claude

Claude supports MCP tools via the Claude.ai desktop app and the Anthropic API.

**Quickest start: Claude desktop app**

1. **Create an MCP server** (or use an existing one)
2. **Edit Claude's config file:**
   - **Mac/Linux**: `~/.claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
   - **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

3. **Add your MCP server:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "my-database": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["~/my-database-mcp-server/dist/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "DATABASE_URL": "postgresql://..."
      }
    }
  }
}
```

4. **Restart Claude desktop app**
5. **Start using tools in conversation:**
   - "Query my database for users created today"
   - Claude will automatically discover and use your tools

**For the API:**

```python
from anthropic import Anthropic

client = Anthropic()

# Define your MCP server
mcp_server = {
    "type": "stdio",
    "command": "node",
    "args": ["path/to/mcp-server.js"]
}

# Tools are exposed to Claude automatically
response = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
    max_tokens=1024,
    tools=[...],  # Define your tools
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Query the database"}]
)
```

**Common error: "Tool not found"**
- Solution: Make sure server is running and returning tools correctly
- Check: `console.log` the tools list before sending to Claude

### Using MCP Tools in VS Code + GitHub Copilot

GitHub Copilot integrates MCP tools for code completion and generation.

**Setup:**

1. **Install the latest GitHub Copilot extension** for VS Code
2. **Configure MCP server** in VS Code settings:
```json
{
  "github.copilot.advanced": {
    "mcpServers": {
      "my-api": {
        "command": "python",
        "args": ["~/my-api-mcp/server.py"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

3. **Reload VS Code**
4. **Use in comments or chat:**
   - Press `Ctrl+I` and ask: "Call my API to fetch users"
   - Copilot discovers available tools automatically

**Why VS Code is popular:** IDE integration means tools are available while you code. You can query your database directly from a code comment.

### Using MCP Tools in Cursor

Cursor is a GitHub Copilot-alternative IDE that's rapidly gaining adoption (note the growth in AlsoAsked questions about Cursor).

**Setup:**

1. **Configure in Cursor settings** (`~/.cursor/cursor_config.json`):
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "database": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["path/to/database-mcp.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

2. **Restart Cursor**
3. **Use in Cursor composer or chat:**
   - "@" mention MCP tools in Cursor Composer
   - Type: "Query the database for..." and tools auto-complete

**Cursor advantage:** Better at understanding context across files, so MCP tools are more useful for larger refactoring tasks.

### Using MCP Tools in Google ADK

Google's Agent Development Kit is built with MCP in mind from the start.

**Setup (using ADK CLI):**

```bash
# Create new ADK project
adk create my-agent

# Add MCP server dependency
adk add mcp-server-database

# Configure in agent config
cat > agent.yaml << EOF
tools:
  - name: query_database
    mcp_server: database
    config:
      url: postgresql://...
EOF

# Run agent
adk run
```

**ADK-specific consideration:** ADK treats MCP as first-class, not bolted-on. All tool discovery and invocation happens through ADK's native agent reasoning engine.

### Security Essentials for Any Platform

Before deploying tools in production:

**1. Input Validation**
```python
# Validate parameters before passing to your system
if not validate_sql_query(query):
    raise ValueError("Invalid SQL query")
```

**2. Rate Limiting**
```python
# Limit calls per minute
from ratelimit import limits

@limits(calls=100, period=60)
def query_database(query):
    ...
```

**3. Audit Logging**
```python
# Log all tool invocations for security review
log_tool_call(tool_name, parameters, user_id, timestamp)
```

**4. Error Handling**
```python
try:
    result = execute_tool(parameters)
except Exception as e:
    return {"error": "Tool execution failed", "safe_message": "Permission denied"}
    # Never expose internal errors to AI
```

### Quick-Start Checklist

- [ ] Choose your platform (Claude, VS Code, Cursor, ADK)
- [ ] Decide which MCP server you need (database, API, file, etc.)
- [ ] Add config to the appropriate config file
- [ ] Restart the application
- [ ] Test with a simple query: "What tools are available?"
- [ ] Use a single tool: "Execute [tool name] with [parameters]"
- [ ] Monitor for errors and optimize timeouts

## MCP vs. Alternatives: When to Use MCP Tools

Before choosing MCP, you should understand your alternatives and when each makes sense.

### MCP Tools vs. ADK (Google Agent Development Kit)

This comparison is crucial right now. Google released ADK in 2024-2025, and it's gaining adoption rapidly.

**MCP (Model Context Protocol)**
- Open standard, not tied to any vendor
- Protocol for tool discovery and invocation
- Works with Claude, VS Code, Cursor, ADK, others
- Requires more setup but maximum flexibility
- Focus: Universal compatibility

**ADK (Google Agent Development Kit)**
- Google's framework for building AI agents
- Built-in tool integration (uses MCP internally)
- Integrates with Google's AI services (Gemini, Vertex AI)
- Faster to get started (opinionated defaults)
- Focus: Agent-centric development

**Comparison Table:**

| Aspect | MCP | ADK |
|--------|-----|-----|
| **Vendor tie-in** | None (open standard) | Google services |
| **Setup complexity** | Medium | Low (opinionated) |
| **Flexibility** | High (any tools) | High (Google tools) |
| **Learning curve** | Steep | Gentle |
| **Enterprise support** | Growing | Strong |
| **Best for** | Multi-platform, custom tools | Google stack users |

**Can you use both?** Yes. ADK can use MCP servers. Many teams are combining them: ADK for agent framework, MCP for tool standardization.

**Choose MCP if:**
- You need tools across multiple platforms (Claude, VS Code, Cursor)
- You have custom proprietary tools
- You want vendor independence
- Your team knows JSON/protocol details

**Choose ADK if:**
- You're already in Google's ecosystem (Vertex AI, Gemini)
- You want fastest time-to-value
- You need agent-level features beyond tool calling
- Your team prefers opinionated frameworks

### MCP Tools vs. Function Calling

Older LLM platforms use "function calling" (OpenAI, some Anthropic docs).

**Function Calling**
```json
{
  "type": "function",
  "function": {
    "name": "query_database",
    "parameters": {...}
  }
}
```

**MCP Tools** (more structured)
```json
{
  "name": "query_database",
  "description": "...",
  "input_schema": {...}
}
```

**Key differences:**
- **Function calling** is model-specific, requires redefining per platform
- **MCP tools** are standardized, works across platforms
- **Function calling** is simpler for single-platform setups
- **MCP** is better for multi-platform, scalable approaches

**Choose function calling if:**
- You only use one LLM provider
- You have simple tool needs (< 5 tools)
- You want minimal overhead

**Choose MCP if:**
- You use multiple platforms
- You have growing tool needs
- You want portability

### MCP Tools vs. Traditional APIs

You could just give AI direct REST API access instead of using MCP.

**REST API approach:**
- AI gets API docs, makes HTTP requests itself
- No standardization, each API is different
- Security concerns (API keys, rate limiting)
- Harder for AI to discover available operations

**MCP approach:**
- Standard tool format, consistent experience
- Server-side security and rate limiting
- Tool discovery built in
- Easier for AI to reason about what's available

**Choose REST APIs if:**
- You're already exposing REST APIs to humans
- You want the AI to have complete API access
- You need external API integration (stripe, GitHub)

**Choose MCP if:**
- You want AI-specific security and control
- You have complex business logic to encapsulate
- You want consistent tool interface

### MCP Tools vs. Custom Code Integration

Some teams just write custom code to connect AI to systems.

```python
# Custom integration without MCP
if user_question == "query database":
    results = database.query()
    return results
```

**Custom code:**
- Works for simple cases
- No standardization, different for each tool
- Not portable to other platforms
- Scales poorly as tools grow

**MCP:**
- Standardized, portable, discoverable
- Scales with tool growth
- Works across platforms
- More upfront setup cost

**Choose custom code if:**
- You have just 1-2 simple tools
- You're prototyping
- You have tight time constraints

**Choose MCP if:**
- You have 5+ tools
- You plan to scale
- You want to reuse tools across projects

### Decision Matrix: Which Approach?

| Scenario | Best Choice | Why |
|----------|------------|-----|
| Single-tool prototype | Custom code | Fastest setup |
| 5+ tools, single platform | Function calling | Simpler than MCP |
| 5+ tools, multiple platforms | **MCP** | Standardized, portable |
| Google ecosystem | ADK + MCP | ADK handles orchestration, MCP tools |
| Enterprise, mixed stack | **MCP** | Vendor neutral, scalable |
| API marketplace | REST API | Designed for external access |
| Internal AI system | **MCP** | Control, security, standardization |

## How to Find & Evaluate MCP Tools

Now that you understand what MCP tools are and how they work, you need to find the right ones for your use case.

### The Discovery Challenge

The problem: MCP is new. Tools are scattered across:
- GitHub (hard to filter, no quality signals)
- NPM/PyPI (mixed with non-MCP packages)
- Company documentation (proprietary, hard to find)
- Reddit discussions (unverified)
- No central, curated directory

This is why **[MyMCPShelf](https://www.mymcpshelf.com)** exists.

### Official Resources (Limited)

**Anthropic's MCP registry** (`github.com/modelcontextprotocol`)
- Official examples and documentation
- Limited to ~20 reference implementations
- Good for learning, not comprehensive

**NPM/PyPI package searches** (`npm search mcp`)
- Returns hundreds of results

**Tool composition:** Chaining multiple tools together (read database → call API → send Slack message)

**Agentic workflows:** MCP tools enabling true multi-step agent reasoning, not just tool calling

**Tool versioning:** Managing tool evolution as APIs change

**Performance optimization:** Smarter caching, batch operations, parallel execution

### What's Coming Next

**Better discovery mechanisms:** Think "NPM for MCP tools" — central registry with quality signals

**Performance standards:** Benchmarks and recommendations (< 2 second latency ideal)

**Certification programs:** Enterprise teams can certify tools as production-ready

**Security standards:** Best practices, vulnerability scanning, permission models

The MCP ecosystem is following the same path as Kubernetes, Docker, and other successful standards. Discovery and standardization are the next frontiers.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: What is MCP an acronym for?

**A:** MCP stands for **Model Context Protocol**. It's an open standard for AI agents to discover and use tools. (Note: MCP can also mean Manufacturing Control Plan in supply chain contexts, or Microsoft Certified Professional in legacy IT certifications, but this article focuses on Model Context Protocol in AI.)

### Q: What is the MCP full form?

**A:** Model Context Protocol. It defines how AI clients (Claude, VS Code, etc.) communicate with servers that provide tools and resources.

### Q: What is the difference between tools and MCP?

**A:** MCP is the protocol (the communication standard). Tools are specific functions that MCP servers expose. It's like HTTP (protocol) and REST APIs (what use the protocol).

### Q: What is the difference between MCP tools and prompts?

**A:** Tools let AI agents *take actions* (execute code, call APIs, query databases). Prompts are *instructions to the AI* about how to think and behave. Tools extend capability; prompts guide behavior.

### Q: What is the difference between MCP tools and resources?

**A:** Tools are actions (query database, send email). Resources are information (database schema, documentation). Tools change the world; resources inform decisions.

### Q: What is the maximum number of tools in MCP?

**A:** There's no hard limit, but practical considerations apply. 5-50 tools per server is optimal. More tools increase token usage (cost/latency) and decision complexity. Best practice: group related operations into single tools with parameters rather than creating separate tools.

### Q: How many types of MCP are there?

**A:** One protocol, many integration contexts. MCP works with:
- LLMs (Claude, Gemini)
- IDEs (VS Code, Cursor)
- Agent frameworks (ADK)
- Custom applications

### Q: What is the difference between MCP and ADK?

**A:** MCP is a communication protocol (the "language" for tools). ADK (Google's Agent Development Kit) is a framework for building AI agents. They're complementary — ADK agents can use MCP tools.

**Choose MCP if:** you need cross-platform tool compatibility
**Choose ADK if:** you're building within Google's ecosystem

### Q: Are AZA and MCP the same?

**A:** AZA isn't a standard AI term in common use. You might be thinking of:
- **A2A** (Agent-to-Agent) — agents calling each other
- **AZA** in another domain — manufacturing, military?

If you meant something specific, search for the full term.

### Q: Will MCP replace APIs?

**A:** No. APIs are general-purpose infrastructure. MCP is specifically designed for AI-tool interaction. Both will coexist:
- **APIs** remain for traditional web/mobile applications
- **MCP** layers on top for AI-specific optimization

### Q: Where is MCP used?

**A:** MCP is integrated in:
- **Claude** (Anthropic) — primary platform
- **VS Code + GitHub Copilot** — code assistance
- **Cursor IDE** — AI-enhanced code editor
- **Google ADK** — agent development framework
- **Amazon Bedrock** — emerging support
- **Custom applications** — via open-source SDKs

### Q: What is MCP good for?

**A:** MCP tools allow AI agents to:
- Query databases and get real answers
- Call APIs and integrate services
- Execute code and scripts
- Modify files and documents
- Trigger workflows and automations
- Control systems and infrastructure

In other words: MCP makes AI agents useful beyond conversation.

### Q: How to use MCP tool?

**A:** See the "How to Use MCP Tools" section above for platform-specific guides:
- [Claude setup](#using-mcp-tools-in-claude)
- [VS Code setup](#using-mcp-tools-in-vs-code--github-copilot)
- [Cursor setup](#using-mcp-tools-in-cursor)
- [ADK setup](#using-mcp-tools-in-google-adk)

### Q: What does MCP do?

**A:** MCP standardizes how AI agents discover and invoke tools. It replaces the need for custom integrations with a universal protocol that any AI platform can understand.

### Q: What is MCP in manufacturing/engineering?

**A:** In manufacturing, MCP typically means "Manufacturing Control Plan" — a supply chain quality document. This article focuses on Model Context Protocol in AI contexts.
